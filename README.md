## Welcome to the Point of Intersection

A website developed to teach about cultures throughout the world to commuters waiting at the bus stop. 

### The Problem and Solution

Texas A&M bus riders wait up to 15 minutes at the bus stop. 
We decided to promote cultural awareness among students by displaying colorful posters depicting the culture of communities around the world and provide a QR code so visitors can learn more about the people in the region.

The QR leads users to a landing page introducing them to the region and country. Within are short snipets are details about the food, culture, events, history, or other tidbits of information.

Once the user learns of the culture, they are welcomed to play a game that immersifies the user in an activity that is specific to the region.
